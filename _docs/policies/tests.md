# `status-go` Test Policy

- [Creating Tests](#creating-tests)
- [Flaky Tests](#flaky-tests)

## Creating Tests

- All new functionality MUST be introduced with tests that:
  - Prove that the functionality performs as described
  - Can be falsified
  - Are resistant to fuzzing
- All new `integration tests` MUST BE validated via 10000 tests.
  - This can be achieved using the `-count` or `-test.count` flag with the test command eg: `-count 10000` / `-test.count 10000`
  - Where the CI can not support this work flow automatically, the developer MUST perform validation tests via local testing.
    - `TODO` Add link to issue for CI automation of validation test runs of new `integration tests`.
  - Ensuring that the test passes consistently every time gives confidence that the test is not flaky.

## Flaky Tests

Flaky tests are defined as tests that fail intermittently.

- All flaky tests / failing tests MUST be resolved.
- No flaky tests may be introduced into the codebase.

### Steps to resolving or reporting flaky tests

#### Is it me?
Determine who caused the flaky test.

- Is a new test youâ€™ve written flaky or failing?
  - It was you.
  - You MUST fix the test before merge is acceptable.
- Has an existing test become flaky?
  - Check rerun reports. `TODO` add link to rerun reports
    - If the test does not appear in https://github.com/status-im/status-go/labels/E%3AFlaky%20Test or in the last three nightly test runs, it is most likely that the flakiness was introduced by your changes and needs to be addressed before proceeding with the merge.
    - Else the test is already documented as a flaky test (appears in the GitHub issues or in the nightly test runs), proceed to below.

#### Reporting Flaky Tests
- If an old test fails and/or seems flaky either locally or in CI, you MUST report the event.
  - Check the `status-go` GitHub repo issues for the test name(s) failing.
  - If the test appears in the list of flaky test issues
    - If the issue is open
      - Add a comment to the issue
      - Detail that you have experienced the test being flaky and in what context (local vs CI, link to the PR or branch).
    - If the issue is closed
      - Reopen the issue OR create a new issue referencing the previous issue
        - Either is fine, use your best judgement in this case.
      - Detail that you have experienced the test being flaky and in what context (local vs CI, link to the PR or branch).
  - If the test does not appear in the list of flaky test issues
    - create a new issue
      - The issue title should include the flaky test name
      - The issue should use the https://github.com/status-im/status-go/labels/E%3AFlaky%20Test label
    - Detail that you have experienced the test being flaky and in what context (local vs CI, link to the PR or branch).
