**DEPRECATED. Please use [`./mobile`](./mobile/REDME.md) instead.**

This package provides CGO bindings so that it can be used to create a static library and link it with other projects in different languages, namely [status-react](https://github.com/status-im/status-react).

Bindings are exported and described in `library.go`.
