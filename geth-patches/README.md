# Status Patches to for geth (go-ethereum)
---

Status-go uses [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) (**upstream**) as its dependency. As any other Go dependency `go-ethereum` code is vendored and stored in `vendor/` folder.

However, there are a few changes has been made to the upstream, that are specific to Status and should not be merged to the upstream. We keep those changes as a set of patches, that can be applied upon each next release of `go-ethereum`. Patched version of `go-ethereum` is available in the [status-im/go-ethereum](https://github.com/status/go-ethereum) repo.

We try to minimize number and amount of changes in those patches as much as possible, and whereas possible, to contribute changes into the upstream.

# Patches

 - `0000-accounts-hd-keys.patch` — adds support for HD extended keys (links/docs?)
 - `0002-les-api-status.patch` — adds StatusBackend into LES code (need to be inspected, some things can and should be done outside of les code)
 - `0003-dockerfiles-wnode-swarm.patch` — adds Dockerfiles (who uses this?)
 - `0004-whisper-notifications.patch` — adds Whisper notifications (need to be reviewed and documented)
 - `0006-latest-cht.patch` – updates CHT root hashes, should be updated regularly to keep sync fast, until proper Trusted Checkpoint sync is not implemented as part of LES/2 protocol.
 - `0007-README.patch` — update upstream README.md.

# Updating upstream version

When a new stable release of `go-ethereum` comes out, we need to upgrade our fork and vendored copy.

**Note: The process is completely repeatable, so it's safe to remove current `go-ethereum` directory, clone latest upstream version and apply patches from scratch.**

## How to update forked version
Make sure you have `status-go` in your `$GOPATH/src/github.com/status-im/` first.

### From very scratch
Use this method if you're up to nuke forked repo for some reason and apply patches from scratch:

```
# from scratch
rm -rf $GOPATH/src/github.com/status-im/go-ethereum
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/status-im/
git clone https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum

# update remote url to point to our fork repo
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:status-im/go-ethereum.git
```

### Using existing fork repo (recommended)

```
# merge upstream release branch into local master
git pull git@github.com:ethereum/go-ethereum.git release/1.7:master
```

### Apply patches
```
for patch in $GOPATH/src/github.com/status-im/status-go/geth-patches/*.patch;
do
    patch -p1 < $patch;
done
```

Once patches applied, you might want to inspect changes between current vendored version and newly patched version by this command:
```
diff -Nru -x "*_test.go" -x "vendor" -x ".git" -x "tests" -x "build" --brief $GOPATH/src/github.com/status-im/go-ethereum $GOPATH/src/github.com/status-im/status-go/vendor/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
```

# Vendor patched version
## Using `dep` tool

TBD

## Manually
This method should be used only while `dep` tool workflow is not set up.

```
# remove existing version from vendor
rm -rf $GOPATH/src/github.com/status-im/vendor/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/

# copy whole directory
cp -a $GOPATH/src/github.com/status-im/go-ethereum $GOPATH/src/github.com/status-im/status-go/vendor/github.com/ethereum/

# remove unneeded folders
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/status-im/status-go/vendor/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
rm -rf .git tests build vendor

# remove _test.go files
find . -type f -name "*_test.go" -exec rm '{}' ';'
```
