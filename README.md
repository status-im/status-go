# Intro

status-go is an underlying part of [Status](status.im) - a browser, messenger, and gateway to a decentralized world.

It's written in Go and requires Go 1.8 or above.

It uses Makefile to do most common actions. See `make help` output for available commands.

status-go uses [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) with [some patches applied](./_assets/patches/geth) in it, located under [`vendor/`](./vendor/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) directory. See [geth patches README](./_assets/patches/geth/README.md) for more info.

# Build

There are two main modes status-go can be built:

- standalone server
- library to link for Android or iOS

Use following Makefile commands:

- `make statusgo` (builds binary into `build/bin/statusd`)
- `make statusgo-android` (builds .aar file `build/android-16/aar`)
- `make statusgo-ios` and `make statusgo-ios-simulator` (builds iOS related artifacts in `build/os-9.3/framework`)

In order to build and use `status-go` directly from `status-react`, follow the instructions in https://wiki.status.im/Building_Status, under the '**Building Status with the checked-out version of status-go**' section.

# Debugging

In order to see the log files while debugging on an Android device, do the following:

- Ensure that the app can write to disk by granting it file permissions. For that, you can for instance set your avatar from a file on disk.
- Connect a USB cable to your phone and make sure you can use `adb`.

Run

```shell
adb shell tail -f sdcard/Download/geth.log
```

# Testing

To setup accounts passphrase you need to setup an environment variable: `export ACCOUNT_PASSWORD="secret_pass_phrase"`.

Make sure the dependencies are installed first by running:

```shell
make lint-install
make mock-install
```

To test fully statusgo, use:

```shell
make ci
```

To test statusgo using a given network by name, use:

```shell
make ci networkid=rinkeby
```

To test statusgo using a given network by number ID, use:

```shell
make ci networkid=3
```

If you have problems running tests on public network we suggest reading [e2e guide](t/e2e/README.md).

If you want to launch specific test, for instance `RPCSendTransactions`, use the following command:

```shell
go test -v ./geth/api/ -testify.m ^RPCSendTransaction$
```

Note `-testify.m` as [testify/suite](https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite) is used to group individual tests.
