# Default behaviour:
# Reverts all patches in patch dir, notes down the ones
# which were previously applied. Applies all from the beginning
# and reports about previously unapplied patches. If there's
# an error, reverts the last one and stops.
#
# Usage: ./patcher -b <base_path> -r -v
# -b: <base_path> is the target location relative to which patches will be applied
# -p: <patch_path> is where to take the patches from (default is geth)
# -r: reverts all and exit if this flag is present
# -c: reverts all to see what's applied, applies all previously applied back again,
# reports unapplied patches in this branch by comparing with "develop" including
# uncommitted ones and exits (with 1 if there are any)
# -v: verbose error reporting about failed patch
#
# If -b is not present, default path is as below ($basepath).
