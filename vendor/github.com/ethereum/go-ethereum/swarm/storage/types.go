/*
Chunker is the interface to a component that is responsible for disassembling and assembling larger data and indended to be the dependency of a DPA storage system with fixed maximum chunksize.

It relies on the underlying chunking model.

When calling Split, the caller provides a channel (chan *Chunk) on which it receives chunks to store. The DPA delegates to storage layers (implementing ChunkStore interface).

Split returns an error channel, which the caller can monitor.
After getting notified that all the data has been split (the error channel is closed), the caller can safely read or save the root key. Optionally it times out if not all chunks get stored or not the entire stream of data has been processed. By inspecting the errc channel the caller can check if any explicit errors (typically IO read/write failures) occured during splitting.

When calling Join with a root key, the caller gets returned a seekable lazy reader. The caller again provides a channel on which the caller receives placeholder chunks with missing data. The DPA is supposed to forward this to the chunk stores and notify the chunker if the data has been delivered (i.e. retrieved from memory cache, disk-persisted db or cloud based swarm delivery). As the seekable reader is used, the chunker then puts these together the relevant parts on demand.
