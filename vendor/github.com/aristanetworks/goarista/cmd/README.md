The `oc*` commands are clients for the [OpenConfig](http://openconfig.net) gRPC interface.

# Running

After installing [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) and setting the [GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) environment variable to the path to your workspace, you can just run:

```
go get github.com/aristanetworks/goarista/cmd/<cmd>
$GOPATH/bin/<cmd>
```
