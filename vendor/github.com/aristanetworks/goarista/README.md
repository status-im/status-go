## areflect

Helper functions to work with the `reflect` package.  Contains
`ForceExport()`, which bypasses the check in `reflect.Value` that
prevents accessing unexported attributes.

## monotime

Provides access to a fast monotonic clock source, to fill in the gap in the
[Go standard library, which lacks one](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/12914).
Don't use `time.Now()` in code that needs to time things or otherwise assume
that time passes at a constant rate, instead use `monotime.Now()`.

## cmd

See the [cmd](cmd) directory.

## dscp

Provides `ListenTCPWithTOS()`, which is a replacement for `net.ListenTCP()`
that allows specifying the ToS (Type of Service), to specify DSCP / ECN /
class of service flags to use for incoming connections. Requires `go1.9`.

## key

Provides a common type used across various Arista projects, named `key.Key`,
which is used to work around the fact that Go can't let one
use a non-hashable type as a key to a `map`, and we sometimes need to use
a `map[string]interface{}` (or something containing one) as a key to maps.
As a result, we frequently use `map[key.Key]interface{}` instead of just
`map[interface{}]interface{}` when we need a generic key-value collection.

## lanz
A client for [LANZ](https://eos.arista.com/latency-analyzer-lanz-architectures-and-configuration/)
streaming servers. It connects to a LANZ streaming server,
listens for notifications, decodes them and sends the LANZ protobuf on the
provided channel.

## monitor

A library to help expose monitoring metrics on top of the
[`expvar`](https://golang.org/pkg/expvar/) infrastructure.

## netns

`netns.Do(namespace, cb)` provides a handy mechanism to execute the given
callback `cb` in the given [network namespace](https://lwn.net/Articles/580893/).

## pathmap

A datastructure for mapping keys of type string slice to values. It
allows for some fuzzy matching.

## test

This is a [Go](http://golang.org/) library to help in writing unit tests.

## Examples

TBD
